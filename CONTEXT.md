# CONTEXT

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to preserve the timeline, documentation, and voice of a formal safety escalation that occurred within Amazon’s TPA4 facility in Temple Terrace, FL, in late July and early August 2025. 

The creator of this repository, Ethan Womack, raised multiple valid concerns regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) provisioning, policy adherence, and employee safety protocol misalignment. Within 24 hours of submitting an OSHA safety complaint and a whistleblower protection filing, Ethan was pulled into a 30-minute closed-door meeting with local WHS, HR, and RME leadership.

This repository was established to:

- Document the content and tone of that meeting
- Highlight post-complaint developments that may constitute soft retaliation
- Offer evidence for federal and legal review without obfuscation
- Provide a transparent account of internal corporate handling of safety reports

## Key Areas of Concern

- **PPE Provisioning**: Amazon’s system requires employees to select and order PPE using a Zappos portal, shifting responsibility away from the employer in direct contrast to OSHA guidelines.
  
- **Maintenance Gaps**: Employees are expected to self-launder fire-resistant and arc-rated clothing, which may violate safety standards.

- **Retaliation Signals**: Following the OSHA filing, Ethan was summoned to a "concern check-in" meeting, involving multiple levels of management. The tone and timing of the meeting raise concerns about covert suppression or pressure.

- **Administrative Access Discrepancies**: Ethan discovered that he has administrative access in internal Amazon systems (such as Learn), which strongly implies he is being silently tracked for a leadership pathway—yet no such pathway has been formally offered or acknowledged.

- **Mixed Messaging from Leadership**: After safety concerns were reported, safety-themed corporate gifts and public food displays appeared, possibly as placation or quiet acknowledgment.

## Philosophy Behind Public Disclosure

This is not an act of defiance. This is **open-source accountability**. The materials here are presented respectfully, clearly, and with the intention of supporting safety, justice, and the ethical transformation of corporate systems from within.
