## 🔍 Summary

The transcript reveals systemic issues in how PPE is provisioned, maintained, and communicated within Amazon’s safety framework. The meeting’s tone suggests potential soft retaliation, despite being framed as a routine follow-up. This evidence was shared with **Maria Colon**, Whistleblower Protection Officer, OSHA.

## 📎 Evidence Log Entry: ARC Flash PPE Responsibility Shift (Slack Thread)

**File:** [ARC_FLASH_PPE_RESPONSIBILITY_SHIFT_SLACK_08062025.png](https://github.com/ethanrosswomack/WHS_OSHA/blob/main/docs/ARC_FLASH_PPE_RESPONSIBILITY_SHIFT_SLACK_08062025.png)  
**Date Logged:** August 6, 2025  
**Uploaded By:** Ethan Womack  
**Source:** Internal Slack thread with Jon Templeton and reference to Luke Seely

### 📅 Timeline Context:
- **August 1, 2025:** Ethan receives verbal assurance from Luke Seely that PPE order submission was handled internally. No further action required.
- **August 6, 2025 @ 8:36 AM:** Jon Templeton sends Slack message questioning PPE status and explicitly instructs Ethan to personally verify and complete ordering of all ARC Flash clothing via Zappos.
- **Contradiction:** Jon’s message directly contradicts the verbal directive given by Luke and shifts legal responsibility for PPE provision/maintenance back onto the employee.
- **OSHA Call:** This message was received *just prior* to Ethan’s scheduled call with Maria Colon (OSHA), potentially exposing the employer’s internal lack of compliance coordination in real time.

### ⚖️ Summary:
This screenshot serves as **direct evidence of attempted delegation of OSHA-mandated employer responsibilities** to the employee, despite previous confirmation that the process was handled by management. It also demonstrates systemic miscommunication and negligence in following through with ARC Flash safety protocols.

**Implications:**  
This breakdown reflects a larger pattern of procedural failure and may represent a **compliance breach under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132** regarding employer-provided PPE.
