(0:39 - 0:59)
Hi, it's Justin. I'm on the safety team. Ethan, nice to meet you. 

I think you know Anthony. We just wanted to talk to you. I know you had some concerns about the PPE and things along that line, so we just wanted to all get together and talk to you and see how we could help.

(1:05 - 1:31)
Um, are you asking what my concerns were? Yeah, we just wanted to talk through your concerns and like see how we could help address them. Um, the whole process for me, I don't know if you've ever gone through the whole OSHA 10-hour course and training and all that. Um, the whole process seems off to me.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(1:31 - 1:57)
Okay. Um, normally when you come to work somewhere, especially if you're going to work on three-phase stuff, the employer provides the PPE, issues it, and I just don't have enough mental space to jump through hoops and click this and order this and everything else. Yeah.

(1:57 - 2:46)
So we have been looking into like a lot of your concerns, so I know part of it was, um, and we talked with like the safety team, so part of it is since we provide enough and we're going to provide you more since you're here five days a week during your training, so you'll have at least five shirts so you don't have to worry about laundering until like on your days off and things like that. Um, so do you need help ordering additional is what you're saying? No, I just, um, as I said in all of the emails and communications, I've already, I mean, it's out of my hands now. Now it's between OSHA and Amazon, I guess.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(2:46 - 3:03)
Okay. Is there anything, though, that we can do to help you? Because we have like... It sounds like what you're saying is that the way things go here is this process. And I'm just saying this process skirts the law.  ‚Üê üö® Allegation of Policy Circumvention

(3:03 - 3:55)
Okay. And I'm not interested in playing the game with it. Are you talking about like ordering your PPE? I'm talking about the process. 

If you really would like for me to lay it out, it says in the OSHA documentation that if the employee chooses to provide their own PPE, that's fine, they can do that. And so Amazon, a giant corporation, to me, from my perspective, I don't know, this is for people paid a lot more than me to figure out. But it seems to me like Amazon's solution to not providing it, especially fire-resistant, arc-rated clothing, is to push the responsibility off onto the employee and say, here, order all of this.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(3:58 - 4:21)
And when the employee orders it, then I guess Amazon thinks, well, now it's the employee's stuff and they're providing it for themselves. So we don't have to take care of it, maintain it, any of those regulations. But that's not the case of how the law is written, how things are supposed to go.

(4:21 - 5:22)
And right now, I don't have, as I said, enough mental space, enough space in my car, enough financial space to figure out how to properly get, maintain, store, and also launder this material. So, I mean, you can order whatever you need for me to be able to walk around and perform the job, but I would like to just perform the job without all of this. Did you want to talk through a few of the things with the, like, how we provide it, what we provide, and then, like, the requirements for maintenance and everything like that, and what we can't do? Yeah, so from, and again, understanding your concerns, and from, like, I've been looking through the Amazon policies and OSHA standards and making sure that, you know, your concerns are addressed and covered through those things, partnering with the RME safety team to make sure we're not missing something or what that standard would be.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(5:22 - 6:16)
And based on, like, letters of interpretation and OSHA guidance, to your point, right, if the PPE is employee-like owned, then they would be able to launder it and sustain it as long as they're trained and the equipment is inspected, right? So, if for whatever reason we had something soiled or needed to be replaced, then it could be reordered through increasing that subsidy. So, from that standpoint, from what I'm tracking, we're covered from, like, the OSHA standards, but we're still looking into it to verify that there's not a gap in the process that hasn't been identified or escalated before. So, we're partnering with the RME safety team just to make sure everything's buttoned up and we're providing you the support you need, and then also making sure the entirety of the RME team here, the Amazon org, and making sure that we're following that appropriately.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(6:17 - 6:42)
From concerns with, like, the ability to, like, launder and care for it, like, those are other things that we can talk through, either through, like, I don't know about the employee assistance program or things like that. Like, we do have lockers on site that you can sign up for. We don't have laundering service.  ‚Üê üß∫ PPE Maintenance Responsibility

(6:42 - 6:46)
I'm aware. Yeah, we do not have that. That was included in my complaint.

(6:48 - 7:28)
Because, I mean, honestly, just to be really real with you, you walk around and you got a bunch of dispensers of earbuds, you know, and it creates this appearance of safety-minded this and that. But then in the middle of the 79 videos I need to go through to complete my training, I'm supposed to go to some portal and figure out what PPE I'm going to choose to order, which, in terms of liability in Amazon, that's huge. Because what if somebody doesn't order the right stuff? Who's checking it? And then they get arc flashed.

(7:28 - 7:59)
So that's why you get the subsidy to order it through that program? I'm asking why doesn't Amazon make sure that Amazon supplies Amazon's employees with what OSHA says that Amazon has to supply instead of leaving it up to chance? And that's not my complaint. That's just my observation of a backwards process that has a lot of implications. Yeah, so we're taking that back.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(7:59 - 8:20)
And that's why I wanted to bring it to everybody's attention. And, I mean, you can have as many earbuds as you want, but everywhere else would issue uniforms or standard whatever. And I'm not advocating for that.

(8:20 - 8:34)
I like wearing what I choose to wear. However, I don't have a lot of money to be spending on extra stuff. I'm not going to spend any money on any PPE that Amazon can definitely afford to provide.

(8:35 - 9:02)
And also, the responsibility for obtaining it shouldn't be another mental hurdle that I am expected to jump through. So the reason that it goes through the Zappos subsidy program, to your point, is to make sure everyone's getting the appropriately rated clothing for what is required for their policy for their job. And it's also to make sure that there's options available for what your needs are.

(9:02 - 9:35)
There's stuff for maternity, different sizes, wherever the case might be. If you need more, right, and I believe Luke had that conversation with you already, there are avenues for us to request increased subsidy, increased allotment, replacements, whatever the case may be, if you need more of the required PPE. So you shouldn't have to pay out of pocket for any of the daily base layer wear that would be required or the over shirt for when you may be doing a lot of, once you go through the training, to be able to do that at Amazon.

(9:36 - 10:13)
So on that standpoint, that's why it goes through that program and that portal to make sure everything that's ordered is compliant. I understand your escalation, and that's why we're taking it back to make sure there aren't gaps in the process from a compliance standpoint to make sure that we're not only following the Amazon policy, but we're following, you know, OSHA and ANSI and anything else that needs to be referenced. Those policies were all written based on that, so we should be from what we're tracking within the realm of compliance, but we're still taking your escalations and concerns and we're making sure that everything is right above the border and where it's supposed to be.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(10:13 - 10:47)
But that's the reason why that portal is used, to make sure that employees have the options that, you know, fit their needs, but it's also all within the compliance rating standards from, you know, 12-cal pants, 4.6-cal shirts, 12-cal over shirts, stuff like that. Okay. But I can assure you, like, there's messages and slacks and trainings being reviewed to make sure is there something within the policy or process that we need to change at this time.

(10:48 - 11:18)
As I said, that's above my pay grade. So we're taking that back, verifying, and if changes need to be made, then they will be made. If there's still, like, personal hardship involved within that program, like Amazon has employee assistance program, the PXT team, the Army leadership team, safety team, like, we'll help you through any of those things as much as we can and verify that, you know, we have all the avenues available to you for what you need for that.

(11:18 - 11:43)
I guess in order for me to have all of what supposedly I need to work here right now, the order for pants and, what was it, three? Three more shirts? So one more pants and three? Yeah, so three shirts, I think. How many pants did you order? I only ordered these. Just the one.

(11:43 - 11:57)
So three and three. And the total came to, what, 700? So the one you sent me had four shirts on it. I took the one shirt off and it was still 728.

(11:57 - 12:04)
We can correct that. So if we could just up the level there. I'll click send.

(12:05 - 12:17)
Yeah, that should be as simple as Luke reaching out and having whatever needs to be added for that. So that shouldn't be a major issue. And I think the button down shirt was canceled because it was one out of stock.

(12:19 - 12:32)
It was actually the same shirt that I'm ordering, which is not this shirt, but it was... Had the button down. No, I got the button. Oh, did you? It was the light blue.

(12:32 - 12:34)
That's right. The thinner one. Yeah.

(12:35 - 12:46)
I ordered one of those initially and they sent me a thing saying canceled. So that was why I had it to the four shirts, if that makes sense. Yeah.

(12:47 - 13:06)
No, they supply all of North America, so it's pretty common for them to run out of stuff pretty quickly, especially like the first of the year. Well, I mean, the first problem I had with the portal, which, again, I understand the idea behind it, but everything I went to click on, we don't have that. We got it in big and tall sizes.

(13:06 - 13:20)
Yeah. And, again, it's a mental hurdle that I have to jump through in the middle of doing so many other things mentally. Yeah, I understand that.

(13:21 - 13:44)
So it's easy to forget, but I don't want to show up to work and not have done what they specifically asked me to get done. Yeah. But that's what we're here for, right? So if they don't have what you need in stock, calls, appos, or escalate to us, and we'll bridge that gap and like, hey, we need these items in these sizes, or we need an increased subsidy, or whatever the case may be.

(13:45 - 13:59)
We want to make sure you have it before you complete your training. This way, when you're out on the floor ready to go, you have everything you need, right? So if you're hitting barriers in that process or you need support in that process, we can help you with that. I can go through all of those channels.

(13:59 - 14:24)
However, it's still something that, honestly, in my opinion, shouldn't be an issue that I have to worry about doing. I shouldn't have to say, oh, I don't have this and that. I mean, when I worked in Virginia at Blackman Service, I mean, I was working on three-phase 600-volt systems, and I had everything I needed in the truck.

(14:24 - 14:41)
It came in the truck when they gave me the truck. In fact, they called us and said, bring us your such and such and such, because we have to inspect it and replace it. And at no point did I have to do anything other than the test.

(14:43 - 15:15)
And that's how it should be. That's how the OSHA standards are written. So, I mean, we can keep things as they are, but somebody up the chain needs to say, hey, what if the next person that we hire that comes in here is just as smart as Mr. Womack there, but they have malicious intent? What if they position themselves to benefit off of this and it just hurts them? So that's what I'm saying.  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è OSHA Compliance Mentioned

(15:17 - 15:37)
In addition with it just being kind of an annoying extra thing that, honestly, I'm not being paid to do. So I think that other than all the other stuff, I think the big takeaway is just make sure we work with Zappos. Like the person we talked to said, if they don't have the sizes that you need, there's other ways that they can order different ones.

(15:38 - 16:05)
I mean, even if you all sit down together and like with your laptop open and make sure everything's ordered and then see what the deficit is and then we can submit the ticket to get everything else. I mean, I have a simple solution. How about I write down the size shirt and pants I wear and then I go back to my training videos about other stuff and move forward and Amazon handles their part of the agreement, law, whatever you want to call it.

(16:05 - 16:12)
I don't know if we have access to your actual Zappos. I mean, I'm saying I have a piece of paper right here. I can write my sizes down.

(16:13 - 16:39)
Again, the problem with the whole Zappos thing in my mind is part of me doesn't want to order it, but it's just a job. It's not that serious. Part of me doesn't want to order it because then it qualifies legally speaking as me ordering through Amazon's private partner PPE that now becomes Ethan's private PPE that Amazon doesn't have to continue to maintain.

(16:42 - 17:04)
And I'm just not comfortable with that, but I'll click the button. Would you be willing to grab your laptop and me, you, and Luke sit down together and just order the stuff? I know it's a lot. It's already set up. 

All I have to do is click that as soon as the subsidy is increased. Increased. Can you work on that ASAP? Yeah.

(17:07 - 17:27)
So we'll work on getting that done for you. Anything else we can do right now to help support you? Nope. And if you need anything else, we're all here on site here to help you. 

So if you need anything, just let us know. That's why we're here. What department are you with? HR.

(17:27 - 18:03)
HR? I do in fact have something, but I've already sent those emails off in reference to a case with HR in relation to the security gate stuff. That I spoke with someone from HR, and then that weekend I got an email that was time stamped nearly about the same time I spoke with HR about the case. And they closed out the ticket and said we didn't see anything violated in policy.

(18:04 - 18:30)
Which means nobody in HR, in my mind, can be trusted to do anything about anything I bring up to HR. Which is convenient if everybody in the building that has a problem that they could bring to HR learns not to because what's the point? So, I mean, I got the email and stuff. I can forward it to you if you'd like.

(18:30 - 18:45)
I'm sure I have it. A lot of times when we do investigations, because that was your concerns with security layout and things along those lines, correct? Yeah, and again it was not about a specific incident or the person in the security department. Yeah, absolutely.

(18:46 - 19:08)
It was about the fact that the building is set up to disarm you on the way out and punish you if you come in armed. But the whole process is convoluted and it can easily, with the wrong person, incite somebody to come in with a weapon that they're going to get in with as long as they've got a badge. And then everybody inside is just locked in.

(19:11 - 19:32)
Now, I personally have an issue also with Amazon continuing to send mail to my past address in South Carolina. Because that is a family owned house that I was living at that is not owned by the family. It's owned by the trust that was set up with my last name on it.

(19:32 - 19:56)
But it was set up by my grandmother who stole my inheritance and distributed it out to the rest of the family and created a trust that owns that house that was set up specifically to make sure that I can never access what they stole. And I found it all out. I've got all the evidence with me in my car.

(19:56 - 20:16)
They have a vested interest in not going to prison and also protecting their $500,000 worth of assets. I would appreciate it if Amazon would stop sending sensitive documents with banking information, possibly my location, to that address as I've asked. But again, I just got told it's not an issue.

(20:17 - 20:31)
It's been handled. But I've got emails right now from the United States Postal Service showing me. Oh, this HR document about your health insurance has been sent two days ago.

(20:32 - 20:45)
We'll start with the investigation first because I want to make sure we go one at a time. So for the investigation, just like you said, it was not complaints specifically about the security team. It was suggestions and improvement for overall building security.

(20:47 - 20:50)
In general was the main. That was my main point. Yes.

(20:50 - 21:09)
So like with those investigations, obviously you put it in through Dragonfly and we put it in a different system to make sure it's documented. If there's not. There doesn't necessarily need to be an investigation done, but there does need to be feedback provided to the security team, which we did the security and loss prevention team.

(21:09 - 21:29)
So it's not necessarily going to stay open for a long period of time because there isn't additional witnesses. We would need to speak to just for say if someone on the security team did something to you, we'd need to talk to you to witnesses to the other person, things like that versus this. You had specific feedback to provide to security and loss prevention on the processes, which we did.

(21:29 - 21:37)
So that's the first piece. The second piece on the address. We don't send anything out unless you provide that address.

(21:38 - 21:46)
That address is listed on my driver's license. So I had to provide that. So, yeah.

(21:46 - 21:56)
Did you update it in your A to Z portal? I did. I even deleted it and still there's mail against it. If you updated it in your A to Z profile, sometimes it takes, as you know.

(21:56 - 22:10)
I can't help any of that. All I can say is these are the facts of my situation. I would appreciate it if somebody somewhere has the power to globally throughout all of Amazon's systems not send anything there.

(22:10 - 22:18)
It would probably protect my life. As long as you update it in all the systems which you just said you did, it will stop. I don't know if I did.

(22:18 - 22:35)
Every time I click through something, there's some new system that has a new profile with an old email address or an old number in it. I don't even know what all systems exist. Would you be able to show me your A to Z account? On my A to Z account, it's updated.

(22:35 - 22:39)
It's changed. And on your ADP portal, it's updated and changed? I guess. Okay.

(22:40 - 22:44)
If you would mind showing me, I can look. You don't have to. It's up to you.

(22:45 - 22:55)
But that would be, as long as that is updated, it is changed. In the meantime, have you considered potential mail forwarding or no? Yeah, I definitely have. Okay.

(22:56 - 23:02)
That would be my only other suggestion. But I can't personally see it on my computer. You would have to show me.

(23:03 - 23:09)
You don't have to. But as long as you have it updated in those two portals, it would be updated. I can hear what you're saying.

(23:09 - 23:21)
I mean, we don't have to keep going round and round about it. But I know how things get built and things get done. And there is someone somewhere that can click a button and make sure it's changed all the way up and all the way down.

(23:22 - 23:30)
That's all I'm saying. I know that for a fact because I build systems myself. So, again, the mental gymnastics of it.

(23:31 - 23:36)
I don't have the space for it in my head. Okay. Anything else we can help you with right now? No.

(23:36 - 23:42)
Okay. Well, if there's nothing else, thank you. Luke's going to work on getting that credit updated.

(23:42 - 23:54)
It probably will take, what, maybe two business days? Yeah, something like that. So I'll just leave the browser open and maybe the card will still be there. So the order should run through this ticket.

(23:54 - 24:02)
So I don't know if it will reflect on your account or they'll just kind of cut a new one and send it over. But, Luke, can you continue to keep them updated on it? Yeah. Cool.

(24:02 - 24:15)
So should I wait to put it through or go ahead and try to put it through or take some of them off? Let me put it through. I would just wait, yeah. Yeah, because so far your account is going to say you can't submit it.

(24:16 - 24:21)
So this is the roundabout way of doing that. Okay. All right.

(24:21 - 24:24)
Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

(24:25 - 24:27)
Y'all have a nice day. You too. Thank you.

(24:27 - 24:28)
You're welcome.
